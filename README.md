### 3. Python Telegram Bot

There are multiple libraries in python to help you create a telegram bot. The more popular one is `python-telegram-bot`.

	pip install python-telegram-bot
	
Thereafter, the python script must continually run for the bot to work. 
To do so, one can run it on a cloud virtual machine, e.g. AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, etc. 
I've tried running on free tier t2 micro and the CPU Credit Usage for 2 bots is negligible, so it should be essentially free.
